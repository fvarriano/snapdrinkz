## üéØ Roadmap

### 3. Integration with OpenAI

#### Step 1: Set Up OpenAI API Key
- Sign up at [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/) and create an API key if you haven't done so already.
- Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your API key:
  ```plaintext
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
  ```

#### Step 2: Install Axios
- OpenAI API calls can be made using Axios. Install it running:
  ```bash
  npm install axios
  ```

#### Step 3: Create API Call Functions
1. Create a new file for API functions (e.g., `api.js`) in the `src` folder.
2. Write functions to interact with OpenAI's API.

Example code snippet for the API call:
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchOpenAIResponse = async (prompt) => {
    const response = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-davinci-003/completions', {
        prompt: prompt,
        max_tokens: 50
    }, {
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    });
    return response.data.choices[0].text;
};
```

### 4. Additional Suggestions

- **Testing**: Set up a testing framework like Jest or Mocha for unit tests.
- **Linting**: Consider integrating ESLint for code quality and consistency.
- **Documentation**: Ensure your code is well-documented, and consider using tools like Storybook for UI components.
- **Environment Configuration**: Verify environment variables and ensure local setups match production configurations.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Smart Shopping Lists**: Generate shopping lists based on desired cocktails
